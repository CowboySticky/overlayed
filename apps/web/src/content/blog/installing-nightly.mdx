Overlayed releases are not quite that frequent as it's just a small passion project for me. So if there is a need to get a new feature that's not yet released then you can install the Overlayed canary version.

### Installing Overlayed Canary

1. Visit the <a target="_blank" href="/download/canary">Download Page for canary</a> to grab the latest canary
2. Install the app the same way you would for the platform you use

- <a target="_blank" href="/blog/installing-overlayed-on-mac">Installing on Mac</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="/blog/installing-overlayed-on-windows">Installing on Windows</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="/blog/installing-overlayed-on-linux">Installing on Linux</a>
3. Open the new "Overlayed-Canary" app


ðŸª© Now you have the latest build of Overlayed!
