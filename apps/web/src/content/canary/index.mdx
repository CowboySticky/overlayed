<a href="#about" id="about" class="text-4xl no-underline">Why is Canary Unstable?</a>

## 1. Frequent Code Changes
- **Continuous Integration**: Canary builds often integrate the latest code changes frequently, which can introduce new bugs and instability.
- **Unvetted Features**: New features may be merged into the Canary build before they are thoroughly tested, leading to potential instability.

## 2. Experimental Features
- **Early Access to New Features**: Canary builds often include experimental features that are still in development and not fully stable.
- **Feature Flags**: These features might be hidden behind feature flags, but enabling them can still affect the overall stability of the application.

## 3. Dependency Issues
- **Unstable Dependencies**: Canary builds may depend on the latest versions of external libraries or services, which can themselves be unstable.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Rapid updates can lead to conflicts or issues with dependencies that are not yet resolved.
